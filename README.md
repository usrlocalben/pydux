# pydux

[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) reimplemented in Python.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pydux.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pydux)

To see it in action, try the [todos](https://github.com/benjamin9999/urwid_todos) demo.  (Mouse-click needed, as in the original demo)

```pip install urwid_todos ; python -m urwid_todos```

##### What is it? Why would I want it?

The [Redux Readme](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is a good place to start.

##### Example _Python_ usage

[urwid_pydux](https://github.com/benjamin9999/urwid_pydux) provides a [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) Component API for text/console GUIs made with [Urwid](https://github.com/urwid/urwid).

[urwid_todos](https://github.com/benjamin9999/urwid_todos) is a reimplementation of the Redux [todos](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) example made with [urwid_pydux](https://github.com/benjamin9999/urwid_pydux).

##### Todo

+ Reimplement the tests :)
